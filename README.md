# PantryBoss

This is the frontend repository for **PantryBoss**, a web application built to streamline refreshment management for office managers in multi-floor office buildings. Logged-in users are able to conveniently manage a variety of refreshments (coffee, snacks, drinks, etc.) on specific floors and locations through a user-friendly interface. 

**PantryBoss** is designed to update a SQL database in real-time, as well as incorporate the latest smart devices (such as smart fridges, sensors, etc.) to help track consumption levels and inventory. More information on this functionality is available at the [backend repository](https://github.com/paolasoria0597/Pantry-Boss-Backend/blob/main/README.md)
